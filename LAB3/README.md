## Lab Program
Create a java program, that stores the details of a student (Name, Register Number, Email, Class, Department).</br>
You can use a two-dimensional array to store the details. </br>
HINT: String arr[] = {{"Alwin","1847207","alwin@christ.in","MCA","Computer Science"},{"Balagangadhar","2011204","bala@christ.in","MDS","Data Science"}} </br>

You need to have functions to:</br>
1.Collect the details of the student</br>
2.Display the details of the student</br>
3.Search the details of the student</br>
With the help of a menu-driven main function, you need to access these functions inside your class and perform the operations.</br>
</br>
Whenever you are entering the details of a student, you need to enter the value into a static global string array, that stores the names that the user has entered. Searching this array will help you to find if the details of the student are already entered into the program.</br>

You will have a function to perform this search operation, which can be used to implement two functionality in the code</br>
1.To check if the name is already entered</br>
2.While searching for a name, you can identify the index of the two-dimensional array to print the details directly.</br>
</br>
In the end, you will have</br>
1.Four functions inside your lab program class including your main class</br>
2.One static String array storing the names (note the program can store up to 1024 students)</br>
3.One two-dimensional string array storing the details of up to 1024 students</br>
4.A menu-driven main method implementing the functions and functionality</br>
</br>
Plan your program with a flow chart before starting with coding.</br>
Since you are using functions, plan what should be the returning values and how to implement them.</br>
